                    <h4 class="text-success"> My partner’s name is Dionylyn Cadiz. She is a nice, approachable, and a bubbly person once you get to know her. She is currently taking up her fourth year of Information Systems in De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde. She is 19 years old and was born on May 31, 1997. She stays in a dorm when she’s in school, but goes home to Valenzuela when she has free time. She studied at La Salle Araneta back in high school. She likes everything pink, and she really loves dogs but on the other hand, she dislikes rodents like rats and aquatic animals such as sharks scare her. Her current goal is to pursue her career and become successful to have money that she can spend on things that she loves.</h4>

                        <div class="panel-body text-center">
                            Twilight is one of her favorite movies because she likes the idea that true love never dies (even pertaining to the metaphor that the vampires don’t die), that somehow the movie makes her feel like there is a relationship out there that is worth fighting for, and that no matter how hard it is to be in a situation where everything does not fall into places, the relationship will still survive just as Edward and Bella did in the movie.

                        <div class="panel-body text-center">
                            After watching ‘A Walk To Remember’ she was really impressed when Landon chose to be a good person and did whatever he could to save Jamie's remaining time for the sake of love. At the same time, it was her first time to watch a movie where there's no happy ending. She thought happy endings should always be two people being together at the end of the movie but this one is different, and she liked the outcome and when Landon Carter said, “Love is like the wind, you can’t see it but you can feel it” because it described love as an unending thing, even after death, it is prominent and selfless and that’s what makes the movie special to her.

                        <div class="panel-body text-center">
                            The Notebook made her remember her adolescence. The love between young couples that lead to a very intense romance, the attachments and emotions are very strong where they no longer care about what will happen next. They just live moment by moment aside the fleeting time and they think that their love will last forever.

                        <div class="panel-body text-center">
                            She loves the mortal instruments because the story of the movie is unique for her. It was a mix of the right amount of action, comedy, and romance for her and that’s what she liked about the movies that she mentioned. She loves the connection between Clary and Jace. They were so natural but she was so disappointed when the ending made her curious about the real relationship of the two. She’s still hoping for the sequel of this movie so that her curiosity will not be halted any longer.

                            Now Is Good is a movie with a great story. Lhen believes that even though when life gets rough, sometimes there are things that make you alive more than ever. The main character in the movie had a terminal illness but still she believed that when life knocks you down, you get back up twice. She believes that this movie is very inspirational and full of romance meaning that life can turn around unsuspectedly.
